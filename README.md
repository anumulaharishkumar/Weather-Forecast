- Comprehensive Error Handling: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Enterprise-Ready: Production-level code with extensive testing and documentation

## Architecture

### Object Decomposition

The application follows a clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

#### Services Layer
- WeatherService: Handles all OpenWeatherMap API interactions
  - Current weather data retrieval
  - 5-day forecast data retrieval
  - API response parsing and normalization
  - Caching integration
  - Error handling and retry logic

- GeocodingService: Manages address-to-coordinates conversion
  - Address validation
  - Geocoding with caching
  - Reverse geocoding support
  - Error handling for invalid addresses

#### Controller Layer
- WeatherController: Main API controller
  - Request validation and sanitization
  - Service orchestration
  - Response formatting
  - Error handling and status codes
  - Health check endpoints

#### Configuration Layer
- Environment Configuration: Centralized configuration management
- Cache Configuration: Memory store configuration for different environments
- API Configuration: OpenWeatherMap API settings

### Design Patterns

1. Service Object Pattern: Business logic encapsulated in service classes
2. Strategy Pattern: Different caching strategies for different data types
3. Template Method Pattern: Consistent API response formatting
4. Observer Pattern: Cache invalidation and monitoring
5. Factory Pattern: Service instantiation with dependency injection

### Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal Scaling: Stateless design allows for easy horizontal scaling
- Caching Strategy: Multi-level caching reduces external API calls
- Database Optimization: Efficient query patterns and indexing
- Load Balancing: Ready for load balancer deployment
- Microservices Ready: Modular design allows for service extraction
