# Weather Forecast Application - Project Summary

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Ruby on Rails weather forecast application that meets all the specified requirements and goes beyond with enterprise-level features and best practices.

## Requirements Fulfilled

### Core Requirements
- Ruby on Rails: Built using Rails 8.0.2 with Ruby 3.3.0
- Address Input: Accepts any address, city, or location as input
- Weather Data Retrieval: Integrates with OpenWeatherMap API
- Current Temperature: Displays current temperature and conditions
- Extended Forecast: Provides 5-day weather forecast with high/low temperatures
- 30-Minute Caching: Memory-based caching with 30-minute expiration
- Cache Indicator: Visual indicator showing when data is from cache

### Bonus Features Implemented
- High/Low Temperatures: Daily high and low temperatures in forecast
- Comprehensive Weather Data: Humidity, pressure, wind speed, visibility
- Multiple Temperature Units: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin support
- Responsive Design: Beautiful, mobile-friendly interface
- Health Monitoring: Built-in health check endpoints

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### Service-Oriented Architecture
- WeatherService: Handles all weather API interactions
- GeocodingService: Manages address-to-coordinates conversion
- WeatherController: Orchestrates services and handles requests

### Design Patterns Implemented
1. Service Object Pattern: Business logic encapsulated in service classes
2. Strategy Pattern: Different caching strategies for different data types
3. Template Method Pattern: Consistent API response formatting
